<span id="CAB201 - Programming Principles-C# and .NET"></span><strong id="C# and .NET">C# and .NET</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
C# is the language, .NET is the framework

<li>
C# programs are compiled into .NET binaries and executed through that framework

</ul>

<p>
<span id="CAB201 - Programming Principles-Interpreted:"></span><strong id="Interpreted:">Interpreted:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Java Script, Python etc

<li>
You write the source code, and that source file will run as is. It is not compiled into an executable.

</ul>

<p>
<span id="CAB201 - Programming Principles-Compiled to Native Code:"></span><strong id="Compiled to Native Code:">Compiled to Native Code:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
You write the source code, which is then compiled. But the compiled code will only run on the platform it is compiled for.

<li>
E.g. a C# program might be compiled to run on windows 64-bit systems, and will not run on other platforms. This is becuase compiled low level code is <em>native</em>, and

</ul>

<span id="CAB201 - Programming Principles-Compiled to Intermediate Bytecode:"></span><strong id="Compiled to Intermediate Bytecode:">Compiled to Intermediate Bytecode:</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Bytecode can be efficiently interpreted by a range of systems.

<li>
It is not a native executeable, it is designed to be interpreted very quickly.

<li>
It sometimes looks like a native executeable, but it is not.

</ul>

<p>
<span id="CAB201 - Programming Principles-Dynamic vs Static"></span><strong id="Dynamic vs Static">Dynamic vs Static</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Dynamic languages are loosely typed, e.g. any python variable can be declared with any data.

<li>
Static languages are strongly typed, each variable type will only hold certain kinds of data.

<li>
Using 'var' in C# just infers the type based on the value initialization, it is <em>NOT</em> loosely typed. It doesn't change the fact you need to settle on a type upfront. E.g. if var is initialized with an integer, it can't later be appended with a string.

</ul>

<p>
<span id="CAB201 - Programming Principles-Notes On C#"></span><strong id="Notes On C#">Notes On C#</strong>
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Strongly typed.

<li>
Static.

<li>
Int64 is the largest integer type.

<li>
'Method' and 'Function' are synonomous.

<li>
Argument and return types must be declared with the function/method.

<ul>
<li>
Having types declared upfront like this is faster, since the native machine code will be less ambiguous.

</ul>

<ul>
<li>
16 bytes large
